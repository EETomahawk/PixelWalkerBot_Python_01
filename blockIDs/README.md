The block list markdown file can now be found at [blockList.md](./blockList.md). This is no longer called README as loading it lags my repo, fails to render some of the block images and sometimes causes GitHub to temporarily block me, due to the 1300+ image embeds.

If you have similar issues loading/rendering the markdown file, use the PDF: [blockList.pdf](./blockList.pdf)
